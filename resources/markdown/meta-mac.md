Help My Meta Key Doesn't Work on Mac
====================================

So you're using a Mac and you're in the Terminal. You want to use the
meta key as part of your navigation. For example:

- <kbd>M-f</kbd> to move forward a word
- <kbd>M-b</kbd> to move backward a word
- <kbd>M-d</kbd> to delete the following word

(Meta is the Option key, by the way)

However, when you type any of those, you see weird Unicode
characters like `ƒ`, `∫`, or `∂`. This is especially painful if you're
trying to use Emacs. The fix is to:

- Open up Terminal
- Go to the Terminal menu and select Preferences
- Under Settings
- Select the Keyboard tab
- At the bottom, check the box next to "Use option as meta key"
- Kick back and relax
