Closures
========

A closure is a phenomenon that occurs when lexical scope
clashes with a
[first-class function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function).

First-Class Functions
---------------------

"First-class" means that functions can do all of the things
you can do with the other citizens (e.g., Strings, Arrays,
Booleans, or Numbers).  This includes the ability to store
functions in variables, pass them as arguments to other
functions, and use them as return values from functions.

Are there languages where functions are __not__ first-class
citizens? Yes, Java (see above) is one example. Functions can
only be methods of Objects, and cannot exist on their own.

#### Examples of First-Class Functions
```javascript
// Store a function in a variable. You could store any
// datatype in the `sayHi` variable, including a string,
// a boolean, or even a function!
var sayHi = function () {
  console.log("hi");
};
```

```javascript
// Pass one function to another function. Here I'm passing
// two arguments to `setTimeout`: a Number and a Function.
// Meaning the Function is first-class, just like Number.
setTimeout(sayHi, 1000);
```

```javascript
// You can even return a function from another function.
var outer = function () {
  console.log("i am outer");
  var inner = function () {
    console.log("i am inner");
  };
  return inner;
};
var result = outer(); // prints "i am outer"
result();             // prints "i am inner"
```


Lexical Scope
-------------

![Lexical Scope](img/lexical-scope.png)

Scope determines what variables are visiable / available
where.

```javascript
var name = "Tim";
var sayHi = function () {
  console.log("Hi, my name is " + name);
};
sayHi(); // prints "Hi, my name is Tim"
```

How did that happen? There is no local variable called `name`
inside of the `sayHi()` function. Due to _lexical scoping_,
JavaScript was able to look into the  surrounding _lexical
environment_ to find the variable `name`.

![Patrick asks a question about closures](img/closure.jpg)

Patrick is pretty close to being correct. Actually, by some
definitions, he may be correct. A function within a function
does create the conditions for a closure, but you have to
return the inner function from the outer one to get the
benefit(s).

##### Step 1

Create an inner function within an outer function.
Use __lexical scope__ to access variable in outer scope
from the inner scope. _Easy peasy_.

```javascript
var outer = function () {

  var name = "Tim";

  var inner = function () {
    console.log("name is " + name);
  };

  inner();
};

outer();  // prints "name is Tim"
```

##### Step 2

Return the created function. _First-class functions_.

```javascript
var outer = function () {

  var name = "Tim";

  var inner = function () {
    console.log("name is " + name);
  };

  return inner;
};
```

##### Step 3

Access variables from the outer function in the inner
function __after__ the outer function has returned.
_Closure_.

```javascript
var outer = function () {

  var name = "Tim";

  var inner = function () {
    console.log("name is " + name);
  };

  return inner;
};

var fn = outer();
fn(); // prints "name is Tim"

// This is a closure. It allows `name` to be available
// for use even outside of the `outer` function.
```
