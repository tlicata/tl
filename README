# tl
A site written in Clojure.

## Local Development

Foreman will launch a local verion of the site
from the command line. This is fine for html/js/css
development, but has the drawback of needing to
restart for refreshing jvm changes.

1) install foreman
sudo apt-get install foreman
-or?-
sudo gem install foreman
2) start foreman
foreman start

The better way is to get interactive dev through
emacs and Swank Clojure.

1) Follow installation instructions here:
http://github.com/technomancy/swank-clojure
2) M-x clojure-jack-in
4) In core.clj, compile with C-c C-k
3) At Slime repl, start server
user> (tl.core/dev-main)

## Deploy
1) Add heroku repo as git remote.
git remote add heroku <app-url.git>
3) Push to heroku.
git push heroku master
